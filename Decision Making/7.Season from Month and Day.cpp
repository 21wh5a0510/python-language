/*The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall (or autumn) and winter.
While the exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because 
of the way that the calendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:

                 Season            First Day
				 Spring       	     March 20
                 Summer             June 21
                  Fall             September 22
                 Winter             December 21

Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter the name of the month as a string,
followed by the day within the month as an integer. Then your program should display the season associated with 
the date that was entered.*/

	cout<<"Enter month:";
