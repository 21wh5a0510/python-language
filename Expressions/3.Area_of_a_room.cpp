/*Write a program that asks user to enter the width and length of a room.
Once these values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room.
The length and the width will be entered as floating-point numbers. Include units in your prompt
and output message in either feet or meters, depending on which which unit you are more comfortable working with.*/
